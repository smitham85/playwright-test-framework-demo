## üéØ Key Features

* **Page Object Model (POM):** Tests are organized using the Page Object Model for improved maintenance, readability, and scalability.
* **Cross-Browser Testing:** Configured to run tests across multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) to ensure wide compatibility.
* **CI/CD Integration:** Includes a pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`) that automatically runs the test suite on every push and pull request.
* **Detailed Reporting:** Generates a comprehensive HTML report upon test completion for easy analysis of results and failures.
